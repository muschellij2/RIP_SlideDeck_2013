Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), or hemorrhagic stroke, is a potentially lethal condition when a  blood vessel ruptures in the brain.  Currently, the location of the hemorrhage is described manually and qualitatively.  I will present a full pipeline to describe the location of hemorrhage quantitatively using X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans.  

As many pieces of software were used to preprocess and analyze the data, I will present the Neuroconductor project, at attempt to integrate commonly-used neuroimaging software packages into R.  This integration and additional tutorials will hopefully lead to more statisticians and R users to perform full analyses of neuroimaging data.
